    "### Hey Techie,   \n",
    "Welcome to the final notebook of this Pandas tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction video, which you may find at: https://youtu.be/N6hyN6BW6ao. In the instruction video, Corey explains how to read and write different data formats using Pandas. To work with Excel files, you need to install the packages *xlwt* (https://pypi.org/project/xlwt/), *openpyxl* (https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/), and *xlrd* (https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/) first - this is explained at 7:30 min. Please note that you can skip the part where Corey explains how to handle data from SQL databases (17:00-28:00 min.). As always, at the end, you may find some practice tasks.\n",
